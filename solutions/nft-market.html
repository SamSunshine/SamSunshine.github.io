                                    transaction speed, security, and the types of NFTs that could be created.<br><br>

                                        technology NFT marketplace. To evaluate different options, we conducted
                                        extensive research and assessments of various blockchains, considering factors
                                        such as scalability, security, transaction costs, and existing developer
                                        support. After careful analysis, we decided to build custom smart contracts for
                                        Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon due to their established ecosystems
                                        and compatibility with popular NFT marketplaces like Opensea. This decision
                                        greatly enhanced our marketplace's versatility and accessibility, allowing
                                        members to create and trade NFTs across multiple blockchains seamlessly. It also

                                        to ensure uninterrupted service as the platform's user base grew. To evaluate
                                        our options, we conducted a detailed cost-benefit analysis comparing cloud
                                        service providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. After considering factors
                                        such as pricing, data center locations, and available services, we opted for AWS
                                        due to its global reach and extensive set of tools tailored for web
                                        applications. This decision enabled us to efficiently manage server resources,
                                        implement load balancing, and ensure high availability. As a result, our
                                        marketplace experienced minimal downtime, even during peak usage, and provided a
                                        seamless experience for our users. This choice of infrastructure played a
